# BlueSky_Bot

### Goal
To create a Bluesky social media bot that can allow users to:
- Create an account
- Post content automatically and regularly to the platform

### Current Status (1/19/2025)
- Fixed bugs relating to api calls from client to server. Now client can make a call to /signup successfully. I also finished refactoring the endpoints in the server.
