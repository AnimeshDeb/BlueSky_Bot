# BlueSky_Bot

### Goal
To create a full-stack web application for the Bluesky social media that can allow users to post content regularly to Bluesky in their choice of intervals (e.g every 3 hours, every 5 hours, etc.)

### Current Status (2/1/2025)
- After an user submits their bluesky social media username, password, text information for the post, and date in the home page, the server uses the username and password to receive an access and refresh token specific to the user. 
- Now considering on how to process the scheduled posts.
